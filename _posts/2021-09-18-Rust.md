title: Rusty Tree
---

The idea of this post came from a conversation with a friend about the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/): which language would be interesting to try next time ?

I was hesitating between going for a known one (like [Scala3](https://dotty.epfl.ch/) or [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)) where I could gain a deeper understanding of it or try something new to me like [Go](https://golang.org/). 

My friend pointed out that Go, even if new in comparison to Haskell or Scala, didn't include any new concepts. And on top of that, the community was still discussing [how to add generics](https://go.dev/blog/generics-proposal). He suggested I look at [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) instead. And I did !

Before commiting to use Rust for the Advent of code I thought I would try it with a known example and see how it fares. Quite predictably I decided to see my tree example as I already know quite a few ways to implement it in [Scala3](https://benoitpas.github.io/Dotty/) and [various versions of Java](https://benoitpas.github.io/Java/).

In a nutshell, the goal of this algorithm is to add a unique integer identifier to the nodes of a binary tree.

# Modeling the tree

The first design choice is how to model the tree. Rust does borrow a lot from functional programming languages so it has great support for [algebraic data types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-00-enums.html) so I decided to use one:
```
#[derive(Debug)] // We could have implemented the Display trait instead (https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html)
pub enum Node<T> {
    Leaf,
    Branch(Rc<T>, Rc<Node<T>>, Rc<Node<T>>) 
}
```

Immediately when designing the data structure, the main difference between Rust and other recent languages was apparent: Rust memory management is manual, it does not have a garbage collector to manage the heap. 

This is a [conscious design choice](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2926697.2926707) for the language as having a garbage collector makes it more difficult to have predictable performance. 

It is interesting that in Go the designers tried to simplify the implementation of the garbage collector to avoid this issues but that [introduces other problems](https://www.akitasoftware.com/blog-posts/taming-gos-memory-usage-or-how-we-avoided-rewriting-our-client-in-rust).

So that means I had to do a couple of choices for the tree data structure:
* First, regarding the ``value`` on the branch I had to choose between an actual value or a reference. 

Using an actual value would have to constraint the generic type ``T`` to implement a ['Copy'](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html) type class. [Type classes](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/functional/generics-type-classes.html) in Rust are very similar to their Scala or Haskell conterparts.

So I deciced to use a reference instead and here there is quite a choice:
1. the default reference is ['scoped'](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html) and that makes it difficult to construct a new tree (with ids) reusing the values of the previous tree so I didn't use it. This is clearly a great feature of Rust to use the compiler help with the memory management, this is very well thought out and the error messages are fairly clear.
2. so instead I looked at how to allocate memory on the head. There are two type that can be used here, [Box](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) and [Rc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html). Box only allow one reference which would prevent us from reusing values so I decided to use 'Rc' instead. 'Rc' stands for Reference count.
* As the data structure is recursive I also used a reference to store the left and right branches. To be able to reuse nodes I also used a 'Rc' type here.

Finally, to be able to display the tree I could have implemented the Rust [Display trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello/print/print_display.html) but it turned out to be easier to simply add the [`[derive[Debug]]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello/print/print_debug.html) statement as it adds a method to diplay the content with no code. Also using the Display trait I would need to constraint the generic type `T` to implement Display.

# Implenting the algorithm

As rust has pattern matching on the Enum type, the implementation is very straightforward and has a very functional feel:
```
pub fn add_id<T> (tree: Rc<Node<T>>, i: isize ) -> (Rc<Node<(Rc<T>, isize)>>, isize) {
    match &*tree {
        Node::Leaf => (Rc::new(Node::Leaf), i),
        Node::Branch(value, left, right) => {
            let new_left = add_id(Rc::clone(left), i);
            let new_right = add_id(Rc::clone(right), new_left.1+1);
            (Rc::new(Node::Branch(Rc::new((Rc::clone(value),new_left.1)), new_left.0, new_right.0)), new_right.1)
        }
    }
}
```

The function returns a [tupple](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/primitives/tuples.html) which members can be accessed with `.0`, `.1`, etc.
* The first member of the tupple is the tree which has the same structure as the input tree but the leaves now containt a tupple with the first member being the value from the input tree and the second the integer identifier. Here I could have used a [named struct](https://learning-rust.github.io/docs/b2.structs.html) but as there are only 2 values a tupple is easy. As a side node, Rust also supports named tupples.
* The second member from the return value is the value of the next available identifier (to allow the function to be called recursively).

This is very similar to the Scala implementation, the main differences are caused by Rust memory management:
1. the match is on `&*tree`. 

Like in C++, `&` returns the reference of a value and `*` returns the value referred by a reference. 

So why are they here present, why not simply do the match on `tree` ?

This is because `tree` is of type `Rc<Node<T>>` so to match on `Node::Leaf` which is of type Node< reT>, we need to take the value of tree `*tree`. 

Value which we need then to 'borrow' to use it, hence `&*tree` ! 

That may seem complicated but the compiler here is a good guide to get it right.
2. to re-use `left`, `right` and `value`  we need to 'clone' the references. 

Again the compiler would prevent us from reusing them if they were not cloned.

# Monitoring the memory usage

I wanted to make sure I didn't increment the reference counter more than necessary when cloning the values, so I implemented a function that displays it:
```
pub fn add_ref_count<T:std::fmt::Debug>(tree: Rc<Node<T>>) -> String {
    let s = match &*tree {
        Node::Leaf => "".to_string(),
        Node::Branch(value, left, right) => format!("([{:?},{:?}],{:?},{:?})", 
            value, Rc::strong_count(value), 
            add_ref_count(Rc::clone(&left)),
            add_ref_count(Rc::clone(&right)))
   };
   s.replace("\"","")
}
```

`Rc::strong_count(value)` returns the number of references of `value`.

# Conclusion

Using Rust was a refreshing experience. 

The tooling is very easy to learn, the compiler is fast and its messages are clear. 

The Visual Code support is more than adequate for such a simple example.

The main learning curve was learning the manual memory management. It is clearly more complicated than with a garbage collector based language, we really need to think of the scope of the values and whether we want to share them. That probably makes writing common libraries quite challenging as like in the tree implementation we need to make assumptions on how the values will be used and shared.
Having C++ experience, how the Rust compiler helps to make sure memory is properly managed is very impressive and well thought. 

The concept of [lifetime](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html) for values is particularly inovative. 

The combination of modern languages features like algebraic data types, good generic support and predictable memory management makes it a great system language as [Linus has also noticed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-on-where-rust-will-fit-into-linux/).

To go back to my initial question, would I use it for the advent of code ? I'm not sure. 

When I do the advent of code there is some time pressure, not just to get points but also because of life ;-). 

So I'd rather use a language where I'm not going to spend time having to think of memory management. Altough that may be an interesting challenge in itself, I may reconsider it ;-).

In my current position, JVM level of performance is enough, especially if we spend a bit of time optimizing the critical parts of the program as usually there are only a few of them.
Most of the code is not performance critical so the overhead of having to manually manage the memory for all of it is not worth it.

Still if an opportunity comes where using Rust makes sense, I'd glad to go it a go ;-).
