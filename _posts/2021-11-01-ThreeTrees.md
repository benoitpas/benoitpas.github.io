![3-trees]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/3-trees.jpg)

There are a few JVM based languages that I have either been using on and off or curious to know about so I decided to cover them in an article where I implement the tree based algorithm already covered in the previous articles on [Scala3](https://benoitpas.github.io/Dotty/), [various versions of Java](https://benoitpas.github.io/Java/) and [Rust]((https://benoitpas.github.io/Rust/).

This time I decided to cover:
* [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/)
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)

Groovy
------
The first super java ? the most successful DSL ?
Jenkins
gradle

Kotlin
------
Another super java ?



Clojure
-------
Clearly not Java !
but still same family (probably via smalltalk), first optimized VM+very good libraries (common lisp)
