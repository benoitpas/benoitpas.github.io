My day job to make sure my team understands _what_ we are building (and also very importantly _why_), assure we all have the knowledge and skills to do our job and help the Product owner with defining what we are going to work on (and try to involve the team as much as possible in the process to help them understand the context).

And it goes without saying that we need to build a quality product so as a team we need to make sure we keep improving. We don't want to disappoint our customers !

I use this blog to document small technical investigations I do as they may help some of you better understand Scala/Java because I enjoy getting my hands dirty once in a while !

*Notes:*

* I shouldn't end so many sentences with ! I'm a strong believer in 'lead by example' ;-) !

* For now I'll avoid blogging on management matters because it may be obvious for some people [who I am talking about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_persons_fictitious_disclaimer).
